# HotelDoorProject
A project made in Android where you can see and post reviews about hotels.

# Motivation
In the last time I was browsing Glassdor and Booking. I was using Glassdor for searching regarding companies that I applied for and the user experience really impressed me and made me think about creating a similar app. I use Booking app for planning new holidays. I thought bringing both ideas would come up to an app which users could use to see reviews easily and also post videos and reviews making them more clear and not fake. Enjoying with both apps and using them almost daily, I decided to make an app named HotelDoor which would have both ideas of apps combined.
